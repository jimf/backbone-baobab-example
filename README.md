# Backbone + Baobab Example

Simple example application that mixes [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) with
[Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab) as an experiment to get a
more uni-directional flow within a Backbone application. This was inspired by
Christian Alfoni's [Plant a Baobab Tree in your Flux Application](http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2015/02/06/plant-a-baobab-tree-in-your-flux-application.html)

## Getting Started

First be sure to have Node.js and npm installed. Then install dependencies:

    $ npm install

## Usage

To run the example app, run:

    $ npm run build
    $ npm start

This will build the application and serve it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
